How to install:
Install gnash using `sudo apt-get gnash`
Then change the path to the roms in the `es_systems.cfg` to the path where you will store your `.swf` files.
Finally add everything from the `es_systems.cfg` to your own `es_systems.cfg`. The default folder for `es_systems.cfg` is at `/etc/emulationstation`
